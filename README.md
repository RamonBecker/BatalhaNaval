## :information_source: Information 

The objective of the game is for the player to sink all of his opponent's ships. The board is formed by 10X10 matrices. Each piece inserted by the user has a size and a location on the board. There are 7 pieces that the user can insert.

- Ship 1: ship size: 5 vertically.
- Ship 2: ship size: 4 horizontally
- Ship 3: ship size: 4 horizontally
- Ship 4: ship size: 4 upright
- Ship 5: ship size: 3 horizontally
- Ship 6: ship size: 3 vertically
- Ship 7: ship size: 3 vertically

It is also checked if each ship will not be overlapping another ship at the time of insertion into the board, or if the ship will fit, that is, it will not exceed the size of the board.
